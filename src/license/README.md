## Markdown Licenses

A collection of open source licenses in [Markdown format](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

Pull requests with new licenses are always welcome!

### Why Markdown?

Because it's pretty! But most importantly, it's easier to read; after all, licenses are read by humans, not computers.

Compare these two files:
 - [GNU GPL v3 - Original plaintext version](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt)
 - [GNU GPL v3 - Markdown formatted version](gnu-gpl-v3.0.md)

### Isn't editing the license a violation of the license?

Some licenses have lines like this one found in _GNU GPL v3_:

> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, **but changing it is not allowed**.

I'm no legal expert, however, considering that GNU provides [a list of their licenses in various formats](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/#GPL), I would assume that so long as the original **wording** remains intact, modification to the formatting (within reason) is allowed.
